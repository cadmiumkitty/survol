survol:ErrorMode,rdf:Property,"The ErrorMode property controls how the operating system handles several types of serious errors.  You can specify that the operating system handle these errors or that the application receives and handles them.  On some non-x86 processors, misaligned memory references cause an alignment fault exception.  The No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag lets you control whether the system automatically fixes such alignment faults or makes them visible to an application.  On a MIPS platform, an application must explicitly call SetErrorMode with the No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag to have the operating system automatically fix alignment faults.  The default setting is for the operating system to make alignment faults visible to an application.  Since the x86 platform does not make alignment faults visible to an application, the No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag will not make the operating system raise an alignment fault error even if the flag is not set.  The default state for ErrorMode is to set all flags to 0.  Defined values for this flag are are:
Fail_Critical_Errors - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display the critical-error-handler message box when such an error occurs. Instead, the operating system sends the error to the calling process.
No_Alignment_Fault_Except - (RISC only) If this flag is set, the operating system automatically fixes memory alignment faults and makes them invisible to the application. It does this for the calling process and any descendant processes.  This flag has no effect on x86 processors.
No_GP_Fault_Error_Box - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display the general-protection-fault message box when such an error occurs. This flag should only be set by debugging applications that handle general protection (GP) faults themselves via an appropriate exception handler.
No_Open_File_Error_Box - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display a message box when it fails to find a file.  Instead, the error is returned to the calling process.  Note, this flag is currently ignored.",ErrorMode

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following ""preferred"" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above ""preferred"" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the ""preferred"" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM.",InstanceID

Network - This logon type is intended for high performance servers to authenticate clear text passwords. LogonUser does not cache credentials for this logon type. 
Batch - This logon type is intended for batch servers, where processes may be executing on behalf of a user without their direct intervention; or for higher performance servers that process many clear-text authentication attempts at a time, such as mail or web servers. LogonUser does not cache credentials for this logon type.
Service - Indicates a service-type logon. The account provided must have the service privilege enabled.
Proxy - Proxy logon. This logon type is not supported.
Unlock - This logon type is intended for GINA DLLs logging on users who will be interactively using the machine. This logon type allows a unique audit record to be generated that shows when the workstation was unlocked. 
Network Cleartext - Windows 2000: This logon type preserves the name and password in the authentication packages, allowing the server to make connections to other network servers while impersonating the client. This allows a server to accept clear text credentials from a client, call LogonUser, verify that the user can access the system across the network, and still communicate with other servers. 
New Credentials - Windows 2000: This logon type allows the caller to clone its current token and specify new credentials for outbound connections. The new logon session has the same local identify, but uses different credentials for other network connections.

survol:SequenceContext,rdf:Property,"The sequence context portion of a sequence identifier for the indication. The sequence number portion of the sequence identifier is provided by the SequenceNumber property. The combination of both property values represents the sequence identifier for the indication.
The sequence identifier for the indication enables a CIM listener to identify duplicate indications when the CIM service attempts the delivery retry of indications, to reorder indications that arrive out-of-order, and to detect lost indications.
If a CIM service does not support sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be NULL.
If a CIM service supports sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be maintained by the CIM service for each registered listener destination, and its value shall uniquely identify the CIM service and the indication service within the CIM service such that restarts of the CIM service and deregistration of listener destinations to the CIM service cause the value to change, without reusing earlier values for a sufficiently long time.
When retrying the delivery of an indication, this property shall have the same value as in the original delivery.
To guarantee this uniqueness, the property value should be constructed using the following format (defined in ABNF): sequence-context = indication-service-name ""#"" cim-service-start-id ""#"" listener-destination-creation-time
Where: indication-service-name is the value of the Name property of the CIM_IndicationService instance responsible for delivering the indication. cim-service-start-id is an identifier that uniquely identifies the CIM service start, for example via a timestamp of the start time, or via a counter that increases for each start or restart. listener-destination-creation-time is a timestamp of the creation time of the CIM_ListenerDestination instance representing the listener destination.
Since this format is only a recommendation, CIM clients shall treat the value as an opaque identifier for the sequence context and shall not rely on this format.",SequenceContext

If a CIM service does not support sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be NULL.
If a CIM service supports sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be maintained by the CIM service for each registered listener destination, and its value shall uniquely identify the indication within the sequence context provided by SequenceContext. It shall start at 0 whenever the sequence context string changes. Otherwise, it shall be increased by 1 for every new indication to that listener destination, and it shall wrap to 0 when the value range is exceeded.
